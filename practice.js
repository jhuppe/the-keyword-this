//We're in a job interview. Answer the following questions (try to not look at your notes unless you have to).
  // 1) What is the purpose of the 'this keyword'?

      //It is used as a shortcut to refer to an object.

  // 2) What are the four rules that govern what the 'this keyword' is bound to and describe each?

      //If a function is contained in the global scope, the value
      //of this inside of that function will be the window object.
      //
      //If a function is called utilizing a dot, the object
      //before that dot is this.
      //
      //When using a constructor function, this refers to the specific
      //instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
      //
      //Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.

  // 3) What is the difference between call and apply?

      //Call takes as many parameters as you would like. Apply only takes 2
      //parameters with the second one being an array.

  // 4) What does .bind do?

      //It binds the parameters of a specific function to a new variable that
      //declare.


//Next Problem

//Create an object called user which has the following properties.
  //username --> which is a string
  //email --> which is a string
  //getUsername --> which is a function that returns the current object's username property. *Don't use 'user' instead use the 'this' keyword*

    var user = {
      username: 'denfrank',
      email: 'dennyfrank@email.com',
      getUsername: function currentUsername(){
        return this.username;
      }
    }

//Now, invoke the getUsername method and verify you got the username of the object and not anything else.
user.getUsername();

//Next Problem


// Write a constructor function, including method definitions, which will make
// the following function invocations function properly.

function Car (make, model, year){
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.distance = 0;
  this.moveCar = function () {
    this.distance + 10;
    return this.distance;
  }
}

var prius = new Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 2011);
var mustang = new Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2013);

//Hint, you'll need to add a move property, with a starting value of zero, and write a moveCar function which will increment
//the move property by 10. The move property will be added to every object that is being returned from the Car function.
//You'll also need to use the 'this' keyword properly in order to make sure you're invoking moveCar on the right object (prius vs mustang).

prius.moveCar(); //increments prius' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.
mustang.moveCar(); //increments mustang' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.



//Continuation of previous problem

var getYear = function(){
  return this.year;
};

//Above you're given the getYear function. Call the getYear function with the
//prius then the mustang objects being the focal objects.
//*Don't add getYear as a property on both objects*.

//Note(no tests)

getYear.call(prius);
getYear.call(mustang);

//New Problem

var myUser = {
 username: 'iliketurtles',
 age: 13,
 email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getMyUsername = function() {
 return this.username;
};
console.log(this)
var userName = getMyUsername.call(myUser); //Fix this

//Above you're given an object, and  a function. What will the getMyUsername function return?
//Note(no tests)
  // Undefined

//In the example above, what is the 'this keyword' bound to when getMyUsername runs?

  // The window. 


//Fix the getMyUsername invocation (stored in the userName variable, at the bottom of the above code) so that userName will be equal to 'iliketurtles'.
